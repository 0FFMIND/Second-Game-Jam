Hi there!
Text Animator is already integrated with:

-"Dialogue System for Unity"

-The packages you find in this folder, like "PlayMaker".
& More!

Please read the documentation to discover all supported assets, how to integrate them etc.
-In case the plugin that you're using is not already supported, you can read how to support it in the documentation.

Have a lovely day!
