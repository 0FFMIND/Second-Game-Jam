  - <wave>Just when TOUCH was allowed in, suddenly a finger was swallowed, causing
    a sharp pain</wave>
  - <wave>At the same time, the panel on the right, the durability is restored because
    of the loss of the worn finger</wave>
  - <wave>But should also consider the number of fingers and coins</wave>
  - <wave>With those coins, the turrets could be placed in these places</wave>
  - <wave>With turrets, it is possible to reduce the number of slides, which saves
    the duality of fingers</wave>
  - <wave>When the number of fingers is 0 or negative, nothing can be done, and everything
    will end at that time</wave>
  - <wave>From now on, try to resist the five waves of enemies</wave>
