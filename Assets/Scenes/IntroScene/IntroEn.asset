  - <wave>In a world long ago, the sun reclaimed the brantiance that nourished all
    things, and replaced it with abnormal radiation</wave>
  - <wave>TOUCH mutations inevitably swept the world, and monsters, radiation, suspicion,
    and survival seemed to become luxuries</wave>
  - <wave>Humanity persisted, and the Oasis Survival Zone became humanity's last
    hope, but the problem of radiation still shrouded the hope of survival like a
    cloud</wave>
  - <wave>"Do not overstep" the treatment of TOUCH and the world outside the surviving
    zone, our predecessors want us to remember this principle, which is the lesson
    of blood and tears</wave>
  - <wave>I hope all the best in my defense work today</wave>
